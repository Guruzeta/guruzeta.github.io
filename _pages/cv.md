## Research Experience

### Transition to Fluid Turbulence as an Ecological Phase Transition  
*UC San Diego, with Nigel Goldenfeld — Sept 2023 – Present*  

- Developed a **stochastic model** to describe the laminar-to-turbulent transition as a **non-equilibrium phase transition** in flows with body forces.  
- Predicted a **tricritical fixed point** governing turbulence in curved and heated pipes.  
- Constructed a **phase diagram** linking body-force strength to directed-percolation universality classes.  
- Provided **scaling predictions** for future experimental verification.

### Electron–Phonon Equilibration via Keldysh Field Theory  
*Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (Rajdeep Sensarma) — 2020 – 2021*  

- Investigated **self-consistent electron–phonon dynamics** within the **Keldysh formalism**, beyond the standard static-bath approximation.
- Wrote extensive and modular Python (& Julia) codes for evolving the coupled system. Tested constituents by connecting them to baths and studying their equilibration characteristics starting from specific initial conditions.
