## Research Experience
Transition to Fluid Turbulence as an Ecological Phase Transition  
UC San Diego, with Nigel Goldenfeld — Sept 2023 – Present  
• Developed a stochastic model characterizing the laminar-to-turbulent transition as a non-equilibrium phase transition.  
• Predicted a tricritical fixed point governing turbulence in curved and heated pipes.  
• Constructed a phase diagram mapping body-force strength to directed-percolation universality classes.  
• Provided scaling predictions to guide future experimental verification.

Structural Response Prediction and Fault Detection from Time Series  
UC San Diego (SE 232 Project) — Apr 2025 – Jun 2025  
• Built multivariate LSTM networks to forecast 3-story structural accelerations from excitation inputs (~34M data points).  
• Achieved baseline MSE ≈ 0.0027 on undamaged data (≈2% prediction error).  
• Detected structural degradation via a 10× MSE increase under damaged states.  
• Applied logistic regression with frequency-domain (Welch PSD) features to classify structural health states (>85% accuracy).

Electron–Phonon Equilibration via Keldysh Field Theory  
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (Rajdeep Sensarma) — 2020 – 2021  
• Modeled non-Markovian quantum dynamics using coupled Dyson equations for e–ph systems with Yukawa interaction.  
• Implemented modular Python/Julia solvers for real-time evolution.  
• https://guruzeta.github.io/sun/Electron-Phonon-Equilibration/

Fluctuations in Non-Centrosymmetric Superconductors  
Aalto Institute, Finland (Alexander Zyuzin) — 2020  
• Extended Gor’kov/GL theory to spin–orbit-coupled superconductors lacking inversion symmetry.  
• Analyzed fluctuation effects on magnetic susceptibility and specific heat near Tc.  
• Selected for the Aalto Science Institute (AScI) Summer Research Fellowship, Finland (2020).  
• https://guruzeta.github.io/sun/Non-Centrosymmetric-superconductors/

Modeling of Topological Superconductor–Insulator Systems for Quantum Computing  
IIT Bombay (Hridis K. Pal) — 2021 – 2022  
• Modeled SC–TI heterostructures for fault-tolerant quantum computation using Green’s functions.  
• Derived thermodynamic quantities and energy spectra via numerical diagonalization.

Fukushima–Daiichi Nuclear Disaster: Spatiotemporal Spread Modeling  
IIT Bombay — Oct 2020 – Dec 2020  
• Built a diffusion-based spatiotemporal model parameterized by source size and advection speed.  
• Reproduced observed dose–distance decay and anisotropy due to wind and rainfall.  
• Identified a secondary radiation peak consistent with two explosion events.
