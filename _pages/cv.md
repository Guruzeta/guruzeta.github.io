  ## **Research Experience**

  ### **Transition to Fluid Turbulence as an Ecological Phase Transition**  
  *UC San Diego, with Nigel Goldenfeld* — _Sept 2023 – Present_  
  - Investigating the onset of turbulence in pipe flows as a **nonequilibrium phase transition** akin to directed percolation.  
  - Predicted a **tricritical fixed point** governing the transition in curved and heated pipes.  
  - Provided **scaling predictions** and experimental guidelines for observing tricritical directed percolation exponents.  

  ### **Electron–Phonon Equilibration via Keldysh Field Theory**  
  *Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (Rajdeep Sensarma)* — _2020 – 2021_  
  - Formulated coupled Dyson equations for interacting electron–phonon systems with Yukawa coupling.  
  - Developed modular **Python/Julia code** to evolve coupled quantum subsystems in time.  
  - [Project page](https://guruzeta.github.io/sun/Electron-Phonon-Equilibration/)  

  ### **Fluctuations in Non-Centrosymmetric Superconductors**  
  *Aalto Institute, Finland (Alexander Zyuzin)* — _2020_  
  - Extended Gor’kov/GL formalism to spin-orbit-coupled superconductors lacking inversion symmetry.  
  - Analyzed magnetic susceptibility and specific-heat fluctuations near the superconducting transition.  
  - [Report](https://guruzeta.github.io/sun/Non-Centrosymmetric-superconductors/)  

  ### **Characterization of Topological-Insulator/Superconductor Junctions**  
  *Master’s Thesis, IIT Bombay (Hridis K. Pal)* — _2021 – 2022_  
  - Developed a **linearized Bogoliubov–de Gennes formulation** for evaluating the critical temperature \( T_c \).  
  - Investigated surface-state contributions and proximity effects in SC–TI junctions.
