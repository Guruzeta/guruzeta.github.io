### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am **Guru Kalyan Jayasingh**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Theoretical Physics at the University of California, San Diego**, advised by **Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld**. My research lies at the intersection of **statistical mechanics, turbulence, and complex systems**, with an emphasis on understanding **phase transitions and emergent behavior in non-equilibrium flows**.



My recent work develops and tests **stochastic and field-theoretic models** of laminarâ€“turbulent transitions, notably identifying **tricritical directed percolation** as the universality class governing transition dynamics in pipe flows with body forces. Parallel to this, I am investigating a wave turbulence at strong coupling in elastic plates, bridging analytical and numerical approaches to understand intermittency and flux-driven steady states.



Broadly, my research combines **renormalization group methods, stochastic simulations, and large-scale computation** to explore universality, scaling, and self-organization in turbulent systems.

m **Guru Kalyan Jayasingh**, a PhD candidate in Theoretical Physics at UC San Diego, working with **Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld** on the statistical mechanics of turbulence.

My research focuses on phase transitions and emergent phenomena in non-equilibrium systems, spanning topics like transition to turbulence in shear flows, spontaneous stochasticity, and wave turbulence.



Beyond physics, Iâ€™m deeply interested in the computational side of complex systems â€” building stochastic simulations, field-theoretic models, and machine learning pipelines to uncover universal behavior in turbulence and pattern formation.
