Iâ€™m Guru Kalyan Jayasingh, a Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Physics at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld. My research focuses on the statistical mechanics of turbulence, exploring phase transitions, scaling, and universality in non-equilibrium systems.

I develop stochastic and field-theoretic models for the laminarâ€“turbulent transition and wave turbulence, combining analytical theory, computation, and simulation to uncover emergent behavior in complex flows.

m **Guru Kalyan Jayasingh**, a PhD candidate in Theoretical Physics at UC San Diego, working with **Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld** on the statistical mechanics of turbulence.

My research focuses on phase transitions and emergent phenomena in non-equilibrium systems, spanning topics like transition to turbulence in shear flows, spontaneous stochasticity, and wave turbulence.



Beyond physics, Iâ€™m deeply interested in the computational side of complex systems â€” building stochastic simulations, field-theoretic models, and machine learning pipelines to uncover universal behavior in turbulence and pattern formation.
