## About Me

I am Guru, a 4th year graduate student advised by Prof. [Nigel Goldenfeld](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/) at **University of California San Diego (UCSD)**. I work at the intersection of **statistical mechanics and turbulence.**

I’m broadly interested in how ideas from **statistical physics** can illuminate complex phenomena — from turbulence to collective behavior in systems both **in and out of equilibrium**. Some of the things that I'm interested in/working on are:

- Statistical mechanics of transitional turbulence. [See our paper here](https://guruzeta.github.io/publication/2025-09-03-tricritical-dp-body-force) and [news article covering our work](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/turbulence-with-a-twist)
- Wave turbulence and spontaneous stochasticity in turbulent flows.
- Machine learning for physics — exploring how AI can accelerate computation, reveal the underlying physics, and aid discovery in complex dynamical systems such as turbulence.

I completed a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Engineering Physics at **IIT Bombay**, specializing in nanoscience. I worked on problems in **quantum condensed matter** physics and **topological matter** with [Prof. Hridis Pal](https://sites.google.com/view/hridispal/home), and pursued additional research at Aalto University and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. While my master’s thesis focused on superconductivity and topology, the nanoscience component of my degree involved experimental work in nanofabrication and characterization. 

> I am actively exploring **Summer 2026 internship roles** in **quantitative finance, data science, and machine learning**, where I can apply my background in theoretical physics and computational modeling.
