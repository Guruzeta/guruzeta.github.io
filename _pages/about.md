<<<<<<< HEAD
I am Guru, a graduate student advised by Prof. [Nigel Goldenfeld](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/) at University of California San Diego. I work at the intersection of statistical mechanics and turbulence.

I completed a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, specializing in nanoscience. I worked on problems in condensed matter physics with [Prof. Hridis Pal](https://sites.google.com/view/hridispal/home), and pursued additional research at Aalto University and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. While my masterâ€™s thesis focused on superconductivity and topology, the nanoscience component of my degree involved experimental work in nanofabrication and characterization.

Iâ€™m broadly interested in how ideas from statistical physics can illuminate complex phenomena â€” from turbulence to collective behavior in systems both in and out of equilibrium.

Iâ€™m Guru Kalyan Jayasingh, a Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Physics at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld. My research focuses on the statistical mechanics of turbulence, exploring phase transitions, scaling, and universality in non-equilibrium systems.

I develop stochastic and field-theoretic models for the laminarâ€“turbulent transition and wave turbulence, combining analytical theory, computation, and simulation to uncover emergent behavior in complex flows.

My research focuses on phase transitions and emergent phenomena in non-equilibrium systems, spanning topics like transition to turbulence in shear flows, spontaneous stochasticity, and wave turbulence.



Beyond physics, Iâ€™m deeply interested in the computational side of complex systems â€” building stochastic simulations, field-theoretic models, and machine learning pipelines to uncover universal behavior in turbulence and pattern formation.
