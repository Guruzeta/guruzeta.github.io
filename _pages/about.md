I am Guru, a graduate student advised by Prof. [Nigel Goldenfeld](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/) at University of California San Diego. I work at the intersection of statistical mechanics and turbulence.

I completed a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, specializing in nanoscience. I worked on problems in condensed matter physics with [Prof. Hridis Pal](https://sites.google.com/view/hridispal/home), and pursued additional research at Aalto University and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. While my masterâ€™s thesis focused on superconductivity and topology, the nanoscience component of my degree involved experimental work in nanofabrication and characterization.

Iâ€™m broadly interested in how ideas from statistical physics can illuminate complex phenomena â€” from turbulence to collective behavior in systems both in and out of equilibrium.
