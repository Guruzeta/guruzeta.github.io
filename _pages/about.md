I am Guru, a graduate student advised by Prof. [Nigel Goldenfeld](https://guava.physics.ucsd.edu/~nigel/) at University of California San Diego. I work at the intersection of statistical mechanics and turbulence.

I completed a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, specializing in nanoscience. I worked on problems in condensed matter physics with [Prof. Hridis Pal](https://sites.google.com/view/hridispal/home), and pursued additional research at Aalto University and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. While my master’s thesis focused on superconductivity and topology, the nanoscience component of my degree involved experimental work in nanofabrication and characterization.

I’m broadly interested in how ideas from statistical physics can illuminate complex phenomena — from turbulence to collective behavior in systems both in and out of equilibrium.
