# Guru Kalyan Jayasingh

I am **Guru Kalyan Jayasingh**, a graduate student advised by Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld at University of California San Diego. I work at the intersection of statistical mechanics and turbulence.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on transition to turbulence in shear flows and aspects of fully developed turbulence. I rely on statistical mechanics as a tool to analyse such phenomena.
