I am Guru, a graduate student working with Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld. I work on the intersection of turbulence and statistical mechanics. Specifically, I work on laminar-turbulent transition in shear flows, and am currently interested in wave turbulence, spotaneous stochasticity etc. Broadly I'm interested in applications of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to complex systems such as fluids.
