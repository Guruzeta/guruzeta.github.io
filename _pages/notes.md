This page collates my notes across topics.  These notes were taken while learning/researching things and hence are written summarizing important things that I wanted to remember/found non-trivial.  Since research is often non-linear, so are the notes with often random tangents/abrupt ends while making these notes. All errors, if any, are due to the misunderstandings of my past self. Cheers!
