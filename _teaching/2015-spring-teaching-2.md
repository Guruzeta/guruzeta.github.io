At UC San Diego, I have contributed to the teaching mission of the Department of Physics by supporting both graduate and undergraduate courses. Here are a few

- Emergent States of Matter (Twice) (Graduate courses given by Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld)

- Phys 1 and 2 series (Undergraduate courses on college level physics covering topics ranging from Mechanics, Electromagnetism to hands-on labs on Waves and Oscillations).
Machine Learning in Physics (Graduate Course, 2025)

This involved leading weekly discussion sections to reinforce lecture material and guide students through advanced problem sets, holding office hours and helping faculty with grading/logistical tasks.
