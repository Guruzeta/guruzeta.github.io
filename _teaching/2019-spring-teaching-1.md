During my time at IIT Bombay, I served as a Teaching Assistant across multiple core and advanced physics courses:

- Statistical Physics (Spring 2022)

- Advanced Statistical Mechanics (Autumn 2021)

- Complex Analysis (Autumn 2020)

- Electromagnetism (Summer 2019)

This involved conducting weekly tutorial sessions and helping the instructors with examinations, grading, and curating practice problems to strengthen student learning outcomes.
