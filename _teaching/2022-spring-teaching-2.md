At UC San Diego, I have contributed to the Department of Physics’ teaching mission by supporting both graduate and undergraduate courses. A few of the courses include: 

- **Emergent States of Matter (Twice)** — Graduate course taught by Prof. Nigel Goldenfeld
- **Phys 1 and 2 series** — Undergraduate courses in college-level physics covering topics from Mechanics and Electromagnetism to hands-on labs on Waves and Oscillations

This role involved leading weekly discussion sections to reinforce lecture material and guide students through advanced problem sets, holding office hours, and assisting faculty with grading and logistical tasks.
